jekyll-import is entirely open-source, which means we need your help to make it better!

## Ran into an Issue?

Found an issue with one of the importers? Sorry about that! In order to better assist you and make sure the problem never happens, again, we would love for you to do a few things:

1. Collection information about your system: operating system and version, Ruby version, Jekyll version, jekyll-import version.
2. Which importer are you using? Note this.
3. Collect the relevant data. This may be data from your database or input file. This will help us diagnose where the issue occurred.
4. Ensure the `--trace` option is specified if you're running `jekyll import` from the command-line.
4. [Open a new issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) describing the four above points, as well as what you expected the outcome of your incantation to be.

You should receive help soon. As always, check out [our help repo](https;//github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help) if you just have a question.
