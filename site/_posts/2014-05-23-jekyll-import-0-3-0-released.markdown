Hey! This release is just to get a few fixes that have lain stale for a bit
out into the open. Notably, the WordPress and WordPress.com importers have
been markedly improved. Check out the full changelog for more details

Highlights:

* Import WordPress.org `author` data as hash
* Add `socket` option to the WordPress importer
* Allow the CSV importer to skip writing front matter
* WordPress.com: Download images locally and update links to them
* WordPress: Import WP pages as proper Jekyll pages instead of as posts

Happy Jekylling!
